# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
Bobby and I were tasked with  determining the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

The Retirement Title Count table shows how many potential employees will be retiring from each position. This means, that in the near future, many roles will need to be filled by new hires. However, these results account for all current and non current employees so we had to filter down the data and came up with more accurate results with just active employees count. 

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Our results came up with more than enough mentors to mentor the next generation despite the high retirement counts.
